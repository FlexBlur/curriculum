# Why Learn SQL?

---
## Content

We've mentioned that many databases still use SQL today, but don't take our word for it. Instead, take Stack Overflow's, which conducted a survey in 2019 that showed SQL as the 3rd most used programming language.

If this is not enough, out of all the databases, the first four use SQL as their language.

And now, let's put things in perspective. At your job, there is a chance that you are using a database. Whenever you need some data extracted, or a report generated, you always go to one of the developers and ask for it. After this course, you'll be able to extract your own data, create your own reports, and increase efficiency.

If this isn't enough to convince you to learn SQL, we don't know what would be.
