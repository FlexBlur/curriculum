# How to Use SQL?

---
## Content

Okay so now that you know what SQL is, and why you need it, you're wondering how you can get started?

Unfortunately, there isn't a universal program or app that you can install. Over the time, there have been quite a few ramifications (we like to call them *flavours*) of SQL[1]. This won't be a problem, as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has adopted SQL as a standard since 1986. All the *flavours* start from the ANSI Standard, and any code written in ANSI should work on any flavour.

For the rest of this course, we will teach you the ANSI Standard SQL. The difference between ANSI and flavours of SQL is negligible, and we will include these in the content where possible.

All this talk about SQL, yet we still haven't told you how to use it ðŸ˜…. In this course, we will provide you with links to playgrounds[2] where you can test the code. On top of that, we will dedicate certain missions to teach you how to connect and use the SQL flavours.
