# What Is SQL?

## Content

**SQL** is a **Query Language**. This means that it's a programming language that allows us to ask for data from a database.

The name stands for *Structured Query Language*, and was developed in the 1970s. Many databases use it today.

Here's an example of an SQL query which returns all rows and columns from the `users` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

Don't worry about this as we will explain everything in detail in the following missions.
